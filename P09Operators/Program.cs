// Slide 9 - Operator Recap:

// doing any mathematical operation is quite easy, and works the same way as you'd expect any mathematical expression outside of code
// addition can be done this way:

int one = 1;
int two = 2;
int three = one + two; // can be done with two variables
int threeAgain = one + 2; // or using a variable plus a number directly.
int threeAgain2 = 1 + 2; // or two numbers directly.
one += two; // adds one together with two for the sum of 3

// Equally multiplication, subtraction or division are possible the same way:

int four = 4;
int fourTimesTwo = four * 2;
float fourDividedByThree = four / 3f; // watch out, dividing two whole numbers can result in loss of precision, specify one as float or double
int negativeOne = one - two;

// Modulo operator (the percent sign %) is used to get the remainder of a division
int remainderOf = 10 % 3; // equals 1 as 3*3+1 = 10
// It can also be used to determine if a number is odd or even by using number % 2
int remainderOfModulo = 9 % 2;
bool isOdd = remainderOfModulo > 0;

if (isOdd) {
    Console.WriteLine("The number is odd!");
} else if (!isOdd) {
    Console.WriteLine("The number is even!");
}

// Some smart operators can help you write less code like the pre and post increment / decrement operators.
// You use them as follows:
int nine = 9;
Console.WriteLine($"Incrementing AFTER I read the value of Nine: {nine++}");
Console.WriteLine($"Reading the value of Nine: {nine}");
Console.WriteLine($"Decrementing Nine BEFORE reading it: {--nine}");
