    Instructions
    Create a Console Project named P12Random How To?
    Ask the User for a Seed and store it in a variable.
    Initialize Random with the given Seed.
    Get three Random Numbers between 0 and 5 (including 0, excluding 5) and print them to the Console.
    Get three Random Numbers between 0 and 0.5 (including 0, excluding 0.5) and print them to the Console.
    Get three Random Numbers between 0.2 and 0.7 (including 0.2, excluding 0.7) and print them to the Console.
    Ask the user for a Critical Hit Chance between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%).
    Then simulate 5 Attacks where you roll for the Critical Hit Chance and print, whether it’s a Critical Hit. Or No Critical Hit.
    Hint: Thanks to using the Seed, you should actually receive the same results as me, if using the same Seed. Test it! :)
